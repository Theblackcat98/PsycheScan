Desc of project.

## Proposed Structure

- Disorder
	- UID
	- DSM-ID
	- Diagnosis
		- Diagnostic Criteria
			- Criteria 1
			- Criteria 2
		- Diagnostic Features
		- Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis
		- Diagnostic Markers
		- Differential Diagnosis
		- Comorbidity
	- More Info
		- Prevalence
		- Development and Course
		- Risk and Prognosis Factors
		- Culture Related Diagnostic Issues
		- Gender Related Diagnostic Issues
		- Functional Consequences

I took this structure from the DSM-5, every disorder has a section for each heading. I divided the data between "Diagnosis" and "More Info", this is to mark the Diagnosis data for the purposes of this project. (I still would like to include all of the info on each disorder for completeness).

## Developing a Database

[[DSM-5.sql]] is my basis, still work in progress.
